For the conditional compilation in makefile, I used 2 different main files, both files uses same main.h header, and make it switch with command line prompt

Enter make: the arguments won't affect the darkness

Enter make DARK=1: the arguments do affect the darkness

I have 16 bytes memory leak from both 3D and 2D array even after I deallocation.
